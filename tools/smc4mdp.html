  <b> Statistical Model Checker for MDPs: smc4mdp</b>
  <p>
  <b>smc4mdp</b> is an implementation of the statistical model checking technique for Markov Decision Processes presented in our QEST 2012 paper. The technique is implemented within the well-known <a href="https://www.prismmodelchecker.org/" target="_blank">Prism</a> probabilistic model checker - basically, this means that you can (statistically) model check any Prism MDP model.
