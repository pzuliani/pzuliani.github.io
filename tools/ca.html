  <b> Cellular Automaton: ca</b>

  <p>

    <b>ca</b> is a parallel simulator for the rhombic dodecahedron cellular automaton, developed by myself for my <i>Laurea</i> degree thesis back in 1996-97. It has been applied to 3D fluid-dynamics simulation. Basically, instead of solving numerically the Navier-Stokes equations, one simulates a cellular automaton whose behaviour closely approximates a solution to such equations. (This approach is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice_gas_automaton" target="_blank">Lattice Gas Automata</a>.)
  </p>
  <p>
    Most work in the area focused on 2D cellular automata, in particular the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice_gas_automaton#Hexagonal_grids" target="_blank">FHP model</a>. I wanted to do 3D fluid simulation, so I have worked on the dodecahedron 3D cellular automaton. The software has been implemented in C on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cray_T3E" target="_blank">Cray T3E</a> parallel computer, using the <a href="http://openshmem.org/" target="_blank">shmem</a> library for fast shared memory access. It also uses the <a href="https://www.hdfgroup.org/" target="_blank">HDF</a> library for simulation data storage (and to solve <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness" target="_blank">endianness</a> problems).
